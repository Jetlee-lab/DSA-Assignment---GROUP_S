# Description: This is a Python program that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming and memoization. 
            # The program finds the minimum cost and path to visit all cities exactly once and return to the starting city. 
            # The program uses an adjacency matrix to represent distances between cities and memoization to optimize the recursive solution.
            # The program also modifies the optimal path to include a specific city after another city in the path.

# Importing function caching for optimization. Iru_cache helps  to cache the results of function calls.functools: 
# functools is a Python module that provides tools to work with higher-order functionsâ€”functions that act on or return other functions.
